Version 1.1.3
    Fixed some over looked item name length issues. (And suphlur (sp) is now Gunpowder).  This change requries you to delete your old item.yml

Version 1.1.2
    Fixed issue with the language and item files not being properly extracted from the plugin jar.
    
Version 1.1.1
    Fixed an NPE when trying to sneak while the sign is still waiting for you to tell it what to sell.

Version 1.1
    Made the sign help short and concise.  No more wall-o-text! (Thanks, LordNed!)
    The main sign text now shows what the sign sells.  The sign info now shows the owner instead of the sold item.

Version 1.0.2
    Modified the process for extracting the language file.  Plugin should work better when the file is manually extracted.

Version 1.0.1
    Included the required dependencies in the plugin's main package.

Version 1.0
    Public release!
